Marley's Umbrella Academy - puppy weight visualizer and prediction of adult weight size

I have been tracking each pups' weights twice daily when possible, and wrote a visualizer
to show their weight gain progressions. 

Once they all are able to stand and walk around without stumbling, I plan on taking their
height (from floor to front of shoulders) and paw sizes (probably in metric format) and
after at least 2 weeks of data, I hope to be able to wrangle a decent linear regression
that will predict their adult weight/height and compare said prediction to the extrmely
generic and wholly unreliable equation of:

Adult_Weight = (Pup_Weight * Age_in_weeks) * 52
